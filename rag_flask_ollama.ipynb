    "State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLM's) are trained on an enormous corpus of textual data (taken from webpages, articles, books etc.), and they store a wide range of general knowledge in their parameters. While they are able to perform well on tasks that require general knowledge, they tend to struggle on tasks that require information that wasn't present in the training data. For instance, LLM's may struggle on tasks that require knowledge of domain-specific information, or even up-to-date information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important to overcome this problem, because it is undesirable to get a non-answer from the LLM, and potentially even dangerous if the LLM begins to hallucinate (i.e ramble on with an answer that seems believable but is factually inaccurate). Therefore, it is essential to bridge the gap between the LLM's general knowledge, and other domain-specific or up-to-date information in order to help the LLM generate responses that are contextual and factually accurate, while reducing the chances of hallucinations.\n",

    "    </ul>\n",
    "2. <strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong>:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401'>This technique</a> provides the LLM with contextual information from an external knowledge source that can be updated more easily.</li>\n",

    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Retrieval</strong>: The user's query is used to retrieve the relevant contextual information from the external knowledge source. The external knowledge source is a vector store that contains the embeddings of the documents that contain the proprietary/domain-specific data. The user query is embedded into the same vector space as these documents, and a similarity search is performed in this embedding space to retrieve the documents that are most similar to the user's query. These retrieved documents make up the context that the LLM will consider in order to produce factually accurate responses. </li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Augmentation</strong>: The user's query is augmented with the retrieved contextual information to form the prompt. The prompt will also usually include instructions to the LLM for performing the task. There is an entire sub-field known as Prompt Engineering, that is dedicated to fine-tuning the prompt so as to get the best possible response from the LLM, and you will get some experience with it in <strong>7.2</strong> while implementing the RAG Chain. </li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Generation</strong>: The constructed prompt, including the instructions to the LLM, the user query and the retrieved context, is fed to the LLM to generate a response that is comprehensible and factually correct.</li>\n",
